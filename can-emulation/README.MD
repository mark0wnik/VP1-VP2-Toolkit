# CAN-bus emulation for VP1/VP2 radio

This part of repo contains arduino program able to emulate can features for radio to work. In short future I will try to provide schematics, and more elaborate description.
Boards used to develop this 'demo' are Arduino Mega 2560 and CAN BUS Shield v2.0 from DFRobot, however smaller and cheaper setup will be provided.
