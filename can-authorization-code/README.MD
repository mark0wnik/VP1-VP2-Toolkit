# CAN Authorization Code

This folder contains testcases and algorithm developed to solve these testcases with unit tests. Test data represents two parts of VP1/VP2 code agreement through CAN; part 01 is "config" part, and 00 is "normal request" mode (after config). I am too lazy to explain it here, as it is self-explanatory when reading the arduino part.
