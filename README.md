# VP1/VP2 Toolkit

This repository consists of main three parts; 
 - [Anti-Theft Code Calculator](anti-theft-code) - self-explanatory
 - [Authorization Code Testcases + Algorithm](can-authorization-code) - only for porgrammers and people curious to maybe extend this (because of some edge-case I don't yet know of) in the future
 - [Car CAN Emulator](can-emulation) - set of basic schematics and code for arduino platform to simulate car environment for the radio to work outside of car or in a car without can-bus ;)

 ## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Arduino IDE / VSCode + Arduino Extension
